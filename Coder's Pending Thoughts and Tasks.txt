so there are several reason why an activity cannot be deleted and i want it in a list form for user's guidance.
- If expense-type activity: There is a remaining balance or ongoing savings in the activity or within its subactivity. User must go to options and choose transfer balance or amount back to budget funds or budget activity funds. 
- if savings-type activity: The target amount is not yet met. User must go to options and choose cancel savings.
